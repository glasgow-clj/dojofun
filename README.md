# dojofun

This repo documents the kata solutions we come up with during our monthly [Glasgow Clojurians meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Glasgow-Software-Development-Meetup/) sessions. 

The goal of the Clojure dojo is to raise the confidence and experience levels of those that attend through practical exercises. These events support those new to Clojure as well as more experienced developers from the Glasgow Clojure community.

This group is sponsored by [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com) and [SkyScanner](https://www.skyscanner.net).
